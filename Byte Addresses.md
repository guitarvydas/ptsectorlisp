A paper about GC I read (while trying to avoid studying for an exam) showed building of data structures (CONS cells) in memory chopped up into 256-byte chunks.  CONS cells would employ byte addresses to reference CONS cells on the same 256-byte page.  If the target CONS cell was on another page, the reference(s) would point to the last few bytes of the page which contained a longer address (I read this several decades ago, I might have some of the details wrong).
