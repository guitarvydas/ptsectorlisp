In the early days of computing, we invented BASIC.

When computing came to the desktop (ca. 1975), Dr. Dobb's Journal of Calisthenics and Orthodontia (aka DDJ) published the source code for a bytecode version of BASIC, called Tiny Basic. 

Tiny Basic ran on the small hardware of the day.

Tiny Basic was about 2K (K not M not G) in size, IIRC.

Bytecodes weren't called bytecodes in the day.  Bytecodes were just a trick used to fit large programs into small spaces.
