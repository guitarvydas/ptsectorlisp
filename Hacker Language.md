Hackers want to develop ideas, not details.

Hackers think that spreadsheet languages are sufficient for hacking, but Production Engineers eschew this kind of language.

Example: I once built a full backward-chaining A.I. system in Aston-Tate Framework (a spreadsheet language).  Product efficiency didn't matter as much as various other factors (e.g. "trying out the rule base", and, business relationships drove the choice of the target (development time was dictated and compromised by business realities)).

"Byte" and "Dr. Dobbs" were magazines for hackers, like, maybe "Make" is for makers (aka hackers) today?

BASIC was popular because it allowed hackers to concentrate on ideas instead of details.

Spreadsheets were popular because it allowed hackers to concentrate on ideas instead of details.

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a mantra for Production Engineering and Maintenance, but, hackers use RY (Repeat Yourself, plug libraries together).
